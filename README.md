A Colorato Board of Elections employee has given me some tasks to complete an election audit of a recent local congressional election. The tasks are as follows:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast in the election.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. Calculate the voter turnout for each county.
7. Calculate the percentage of votes each county received out of the total number of votes.
8. Determine the county with the highest turnout.

# Purpose
